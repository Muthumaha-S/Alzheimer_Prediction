# Alzheimer_Prediction

This repository contains a **Machine Learning pipeline** and a **Flask web application prototype** for predicting **Alzheimerâ€™s disease**.  
It includes two notebooks: one for model development and one for app logic.

##  Project Overview
Alzheimerâ€™s disease is a progressive neurological disorder.  
This project demonstrates:  
1. **Model Development** â€“ training and evaluating ML models for Alzheimerâ€™s prediction.  
2. **Flask App Prototype** â€“ building an interactive application for running predictions on uploaded images.  

---

##  Features
- Data preprocessing & cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- ML model training & evaluation  
- Flask-based interactive app for predictions  
- Visualizations of results  

---

##  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **Flask**
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**

---

##  Results
- Built ML models to predict Alzheimerâ€™s disease categories.  
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Developed a **Flask web app prototype** (`app_py.ipynb`) to demonstrate practical use.

##  How to Run

###  1. Run `main.ipynb` (Model Development)
1. Open `main.ipynb` in **Google Colab** or Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run all cells to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.  
   - Train ML models.  
   - Evaluate performance.  
3. Results and visualizations will be shown directly in the notebook.  

---

###  2. Run `app_py.ipynb` (Flask App Prototype)

#### Option A: Run in **Google Colab** with ngrok
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   !pip install flask flask-ngrok tensorflow opencv-python
2.Run all cells â†’ A public ngrok URL will appear (e.g. http://xxxx.ngrok.io).

 3.Open that link in your browser â†’ Upload an image â†’ Get Alzheimerâ€™s prediction.
### ðŸš€ Option B: Run Locally (Recommended for Development)

#### 1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/Muthumaha-S/Alzheimer_Prediction.git
   cd Alzheimer_Prediction

#### 2. Install dependencies
     pip install flask tensorflow opencv-python

#### 3. Place your trained model file
Copy your trained model (alzheimer_prediction_model.h5) into the project folder.

#### 4. Run the app
   ##### Option 1: Run app_py.ipynb directly in Jupyter Notebook.
   ##### Option 2: Convert notebook to .py and run.
          python app.py

#### 5. Open in browser
